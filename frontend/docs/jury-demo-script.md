### Phase 1: Problem & First Impression (0:00 – 0:30)

- **Spoken Pitch:**  
  *"In Algeria, over 200,000 Deaf citizens rely on Algerian Sign Language (LSA). When a Deaf patient arrives at a pharmacy or emergency room without an interpreter, simple misunderstandings over medications can be dangerous. This is LSA Bridge — an installable PWA designed for two-way conversations without requiring internet access."*
- **Action on Screen:**
  1. Open the application at the dashboard.
  2. Click the Language dropdown in the header and select **العربية (Arabic)**.
  3. Point out the instant switch to a native RTL layout (IBM Plex Sans Arabic typography, mirrored icons, and clean alignment).
  4. Switch back to French or English depending on jury preference.
  5. Click **"Nouvelle conversation" (New Conversation)** $\rightarrow$ select **Pharmacie / Santé**.

### Phase 2: Sign-to-Language: Deaf Patient to Pharmacist (0:30 – 1:15)

  1. Click **"Démarrer la caméra"** (or activate **"Demo Coach"** scenario: *Pharmacie - Mal de tête*).
  2. The camera viewport lights up with green tracking bounds.
  3. Signer makes signs: `BONJOUR` $\rightarrow$ `MAL_TETE` $\rightarrow$ `DOULEUR_FORTE` $\rightarrow$ `MEDICAMENT`.
  4. Point out the **Confidence Indicator** showing 94% (High) and the **Detected Sign Chips** appearing chronologically.
  5. Hands drop below chest $\rightarrow$ 800ms rest triggers automatic segmentation without touching the screen.
  6. The proposed sentence appears in the confirmation card: *"Bonjour, j'ai un violent mal de tête, avez-vous un médicament ?"*
  7. Click **"Confirmer & Envoyer"**.

### Phase 3: Language-to-Sign: Pharmacist to Deaf Patient (1:15 – 2:00)

  *"Now, the pharmacist replies in spoken or written French or Arabic. Watch how LSA Bridge parses medical dosage and translates it into high-definition sign clips."*
- **Action on Screen:**

     `"Prenez deux comprimés par jour après le repas pendant 5 jours"`  
     *(Or click the microphone icon and speak the sentence aloud).*
  2. Click **"Traduire en LSA"**.
  3. The **SignPlayer** animates:

### Phase 4: Emergency Medical Sheet (2:00 – 2:35)

  1. Click the red **"Urgence" (Emergency)** button in the top bar.
  2. A high-contrast medical sheet opens instantly.
  3. Show the instant emergency cards: *"Difficulté à respirer"*, *"Douleur thoracique"*, *"Allergie grave"*.
  4. Click an emergency card: it plays an emergency alarm tone, broadcasts full-screen high-visibility medical cards with Arabic/French instructions, and copies emergency contact numbers.
